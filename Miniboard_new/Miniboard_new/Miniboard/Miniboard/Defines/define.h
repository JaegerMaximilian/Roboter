 * \brief
 *      Includes general definitions, e.g. task-numbers,... .
 *
 *      
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead would decrease code performance. 
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 *
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      The file includes general definitions.
