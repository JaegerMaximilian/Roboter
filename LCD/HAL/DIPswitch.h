 * \brief
 *      DIP-switch driver header file.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes and enumerator definitions
 *      for various configuration parameters to deal with the DIP-switch.
 *
 *      The driver is not intended for size and/or speed critical code, since
 *      most functions are just a few lines of code, and the function call
 *      overhead would decrease code performance. 
 *
 *      For size and/or speed critical code, it is recommended to copy the
 *      function contents directly into your application instead of making
 *      a function call.
 *
 *
 * \par Schematic Miniboard V3.0:
 *      Hardware details are shown in the schematic Miniboard V3.0, page 1, sector C6
 *
 * \par Documentation
 *      The file provide functions to read out the DIP-switch individual or 
 *      in total (range: 0 ... 15)
